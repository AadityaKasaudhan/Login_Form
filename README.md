Login Form with React, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, and Bootstrap This project implements a simple login form using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) along with Bootstrap for styling. It allows users to register with a username and password, which are then stored in a MongoDB database. Users can then log in using their credentials, with the backend verifying their identity.
